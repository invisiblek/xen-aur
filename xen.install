===> IMPORTANT NOTICES:

In order to complete the installation, and enable Xen,
at the very least you must:
1. If using GRUB2, edit your GRUB2 config files as specified at
    https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Xen#Bootloader_Configuration

    Support for the grub-mkconfig command was added, and will auto-discover
     the deployed xen hypervisor and linux kernel
2. If booting via efi, copy the example /etc/xen/efi-xen.cfg to /boot/xen.cfg
   and edit the contents to match the settings you need.
3. Issue the following commands to allow you to create and start VMs:

    systemctl enable xen-qemu-dom0-disk-backend.service
    systemctl enable xen-init-dom0.service
    systemctl enable xenconsoled.service

   Other optional services are:
    systemctl enable xen-watchdog.service

4. If you want some domains to automatically start up/shutdown, run the following:
    systemctl enable xendomains.service

For more information refer to the Wiki:
    https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Xen
